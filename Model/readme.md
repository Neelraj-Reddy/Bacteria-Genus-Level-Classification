# Model Selection and Fine Tuning

- Model 1 - simple CNN based architecture
- Model 2 - VGG16 with imagenet pretrained weights
- Model 3 - CNN with LSTM
- Model 4 - Improved VGG16 with imagenet pretrained weights
- Model 5 - Attention mechanism based Imageclassifier with ResNet50 as backbone
- Model 6 - Bayesian optimization on custom CNN architecture
